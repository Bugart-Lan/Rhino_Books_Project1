Welcome to <strong>Rhino Books!</strong>

As Mark Twin says, <strong>“Good friends, good books, and a sleepy conscience: this is the ideal life.”</strong> Here, at <strong> Rhino Books</strong>, we share as many as 5000 books with you; you can find detailed information about the books, including isbn, year, author,  ratings, and so forth. Moreover, you can know how others feel about the books, and we invite you to share your opinion with us! You can post your reviews along with your rating for the book at the bottom of the page. Also, please beware of the captital letter when you search; captialized words and uncapitalized words would yield different results.

In this project, we used Heroku for database, flask for the server part. We also use Goodreads' API so that you can know how global users rate the books. `template` folder contains all the <strong>html</strong> files and `static` folder contains all the logos, icons, and <strong>css</strong> files. `import.py` imports all the books from <strong>books.csv</strong> file to the database. `application.py` is where all the cool stuffs work.

In order for you to try, download it (and <strong>flask</strong> if you haven't) and open <strong>cmd</strong> type `flask run`, paste the <strong>url</strong> to the browser, create a account (it's simple and take less than 30 seconds), and have fun!
